# An Analysis Of Happiness

I was curious about how the COVID-19 pandemic affected different countries in terms of general happiness, which inspired me to create this Tableau Story. I used the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report">World Happiness Report</a> to observe how a country's happiness score changed from 2015-2020. I also tried to answer the age old question, "Can money buy happiness?". 

Data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/world-happiness-report-preprocessed?resource=download">World Happiness Report (Preprocessed)</a>.
